## 📌 Key Highlights  
- **First-ever** application of a **Mendeley crop dataset** for **crop recommendation**.  
- **IoT integration** for real-time monitoring of **soil and climate conditions**.  
- Utilization of **machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, ANN)** for accurate crop prediction.  
- **Feature engineering and EDA** to extract meaningful insights from soil, weather, and geospatial data.  
- **Scalable and adaptable**, ensuring flexibility across diverse agricultural regions.  

## 🔬 Methodology  
1. **Data Collection**: Soil and climate data sourced from Mendeley and trusted agricultural databases.  
2. **Preprocessing & Analysis**: Cleaning, feature selection, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
3. **Model Development**: Training and evaluating ML models for precise crop recommendations.  
4. **System Design**: IoT-based architecture for real-time monitoring and automated recommendations.  

## 🎯 Impact & Contribution  
- **Bridges IoT & ML for precision agriculture**, enhancing decision-making for farmers.  
- **Promotes smart farming**, reducing waste and optimizing crop selection.  
- **Expands research frontiers** by being the first to utilize this dataset for crop recommendation.
